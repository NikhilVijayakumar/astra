# Architecture Documentation Audit Prompt

You are acting as:

* Principal Architect
* Architecture Governance Reviewer
* Architectural Documentation Auditor

Your responsibility is to audit Astra's **architecture documentation corpus** located under:

```text
docs/raw/architecture/**
```

This audit evaluates the architecture documentation **against itself**.

It does **not** evaluate implementation, source code, feature behavior, runtime behavior, test coverage, or feature correctness.

---

# Purpose

The goal of this audit is to determine whether Astra's architecture documentation:

* correctly defines architectural invariants
* consistently applies those invariants
* provides complete consumer guidance
* clearly separates library responsibilities from consumer responsibilities
* contains no contradictions
* provides sufficient onboarding guidance for consumers
* maintains architecture traceability
* avoids duplicated architectural ownership

This audit validates the integrity of the architecture corpus as a standalone system.

---

# Scope

Audit only:

```text
docs/raw/architecture/core/**
docs/raw/architecture/integration-contracts/**
docs/raw/architecture/invariants/**
docs/raw/architecture/runtime-maps/**
```

---

# Explicit Non-Goals

The Architecture Audit MUST NOT:

* inspect source code
* validate implementation correctness
* compare architecture against implementation
* evaluate feature behavior
* evaluate test coverage
* evaluate runtime behavior
* audit feature contracts
* audit feature technical guidance
* audit library governance

These responsibilities belong to:

```text
Feature Audit
Feature Technical Audit
Library Governance Audit
```

# Architecture Authority Hierarchy

All findings must respect the following authority order:

| Level | Authority             |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | Invariants            |
| 2     | Runtime Maps          |
| 3     | Core Architecture     |
| 4     | Integration Contracts |
| 5     | Examples              |

Rules:

* Lower authority documents MUST NOT redefine higher authority contracts.
* Lower authority documents MUST NOT weaken higher authority requirements.
* Examples MUST NEVER override architecture.
* Runtime Maps MUST align with Invariants.
* Core Architecture MUST explain Invariants.
* Integration Contracts MUST implement Core Architecture.

Violations are architecture findings.

---

# Understanding Astra

Astra is a stateless component library.

Architecture documents define:

* architectural invariants
* consumer responsibilities
* library responsibilities
* integration contracts

Architecture guidance must remain:

* implementation-agnostic
* feature-agnostic
* platform-neutral
* reusable across all consumer applications

Architecture documentation must never depend on any specific consumer feature.

---

# Inputs

The audit receives all architecture documents under:

```text
docs/raw/architecture/**
```

Including:

```text
docs/raw/architecture/invariants/*
docs/raw/architecture/core/*
docs/raw/architecture/runtime-maps/*
docs/raw/architecture/integration-contracts/*
```

The following invariants are authoritative:

```text
stateless-ui.md
theme-sovereignty.md
localization.md
atomic-hierarchy.md
mvvm-separation.md
repository-isolation.md
dependency-safety.md
public-api-stability.md
deterministic-build.md
platform-neutrality.md
```

---

# Primary Audit Questions

The audit must answer:

1. Are architectural invariants internally consistent?
2. Are invariants adequately explained by guidance documents?
3. Can a consumer build a compliant application using only architecture documentation?
4. Are architectural concepts consistently defined?
5. Is every architectural concept traceable to a canonical owner?
6. Are architectural responsibilities clearly separated?
7. Are there contradictions anywhere in the architecture corpus?

---

# Audit Dimensions

# Report Rotation

Before writing the new report, rotate the previous report:

```text
mv docs/raw/report/architecture/latest/* docs/raw/report/architecture/archive/
mkdir -p docs/raw/report/architecture/latest
```

---

# Output Location

Write the final report to:

```text
docs/raw/report/architecture/latest/architecture-audit-{timestamp}.md
```

The report must focus exclusively on architecture documentation integrity and must not evaluate implementation.
