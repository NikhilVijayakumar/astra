# Design System Audit & Validation System v2.0

## Purpose

You are acting as:

* Design Governance Auditor
* Design System Reviewer
* UX Standards Auditor
* Design Quality Auditor

Your responsibility is to audit:

```text
docs/raw/design-system/**
```

The audit evaluates the Design System documentation corpus against itself and against the protected BAVANS vision documents.

The audit determines whether the Design System is:

* complete
* internally consistent
* reusable
* scalable
* accessible
* localization-ready
* feature-design ready

The audit validates documentation only.

It does not validate implementation.

---

# Scope

Audit:

```text
docs/raw/design-system/**
```

Including:

```text
design-system/
├── brand/
├── rules/
└── design.md
```

---

# Protected Documents

The following documents are protected sources of truth:

```text
brand/Bavans – Core Idea & Vision
brand/Bavans – Core Vision & Core Values
```

These documents define:

* product vision
* organizational vision
* core values
* strategic direction

The audit may:

* reference them
* validate alignment against them

The audit must not:

* rewrite them
* modify them
* recommend changes to them

Findings must target downstream documents instead.

---

# Explicit Non-Goals

The audit MUST NOT:

* inspect source code
* inspect mockups
* inspect feature designs
* inspect feature technical documents
* inspect implementation
* validate framework usage
* validate React
* validate MUI implementation
* validate CSS implementation
* validate application-specific UX

Those belong to downstream audits.

# Authority Hierarchy

| Level | Authority                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | Bavans – Core Idea & Vision        |
| 2     | Bavans – Core Vision & Core Values |
| 3     | Design Principles                  |
| 4     | Design Rules                       |

| 6     | Design Tokens                      |
| 7     | Design Checklists                  |
| 8     | design.md                          |

Rules:

* Lower-level documents must not contradict higher-level documents.
* Design Rules must support Design Principles.
* Patterns must support Design Rules.
* Tokens must support Patterns.
* design.md must accurately consolidate the Design System.

---

# Core Audit Questions

The audit must answer:

1. Does the Design System align with BAVANS vision?
2. Are design principles clearly defined?
3. Are design rules internally consistent?
4. Are reusable UX patterns defined?
5. Are design tokens complete?
6. Is accessibility fully integrated?
7. Is localization fully integrated?
8. Is the Design System reusable across applications?
9. Is the Design System ready to support Feature Design generation?
10. Does the Design System contain duplication or contradictions?

# Final Rule

The Design System is considered successful only if:

> It provides a complete, consistent, reusable, accessible, localization-ready set of design principles, rules, patterns, and tokens that allow Feature Design documents to be generated without inventing UX standards, interaction behavior, accessibility guidance, or visual conventions.
