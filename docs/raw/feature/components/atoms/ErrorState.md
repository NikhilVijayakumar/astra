# ErrorState

A centered error display that shows when an operation fails.

## Overview

Displays an error message with appropriate visual treatment for error states. Accepts an optional custom error message; falls back to a localized default message when none is provided. Centered within its container.

## Responsibilities

- Display an error message with error-appropriate visual styling
- Show a custom error message when provided
- Fall back to a localized default message when no custom message is given

## Non-Responsibilities

- Does not capture or log errors to any service
- Does not provide retry, dismiss, or action callbacks
- Does not display error codes, stack traces, or technical details
- Does not manage error recovery or state transitions

## Core Concepts

- **Fallback chain pattern:** The component resolves display text by checking custom message first, then localized default, then empty state. No branch throws.
- **Optional prop with conditional rendering:** The message is optional — the component adapts its output based on presence or absence.
- **Purely presentational atom:** No state, no callbacks, no error recovery logic.

## States

- **Error** — Active rendering state; error message displayed
- **Empty** — No message provided and localization key missing; renders with no visible text

## Edge Cases

- No message provided: Falls back to localized default message
- Missing localization key: Renders with no visible content
- Extremely long message text: Text wraps within the container
- Multiple instances: Each renders independently with no coordination

## Error Conditions

- Missing message and missing localization key — Alert renders with no visible content

## User Journey

### Entry Conditions
An async operation fails and the parent component switches from loading state to error state.

### Primary Flow
The user sees a centered error message — if a custom message was provided it shows that, otherwise a localized default error text appears.

### Alternate Flows
No message is provided and the localization key is missing — the component renders no visible content.

### Failure Flows
The operation fails but no error state component is rendered — the user sees a broken or blank UI.

### Recovery Flows
The user retries the operation through a mechanism outside this component (retry button in parent).

### Exit Conditions
The user acknowledges the error and either retries or navigates away.

## Workflow

### Trigger
An application operation fails and the parent component enters error state.

### Preconditions
The parent component detects a failure and renders this component with an optional custom error message.

### Steps
The component displays the custom message or falls back to the localized default error text.

### Outcomes
The user is informed that an error occurred.

### Exceptions
No message and no localization key — the component renders invisibly.

### Completion Criteria
The error message is displayed and the user is aware of the failure.
