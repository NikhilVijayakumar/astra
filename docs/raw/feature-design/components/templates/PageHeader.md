# Overview
The PageHeader establishes the context for a given screen by displaying a prominent title, subtitle, and primary/secondary actions. It acts as the standard anchoring element across the application, ensuring a consistent user experience when navigating between different sections.

# Feature Summary
- **Purpose**: Orient the user to the current page and provide immediate access to primary page-level actions.
- **Responsibilities**: Render the title, subtitle, leading/trailing metadata, and responsive action buttons.
- **Non-Responsibilities**: Handling the actual logic of actions, providing secondary navigation (tabs/breadcrumbs), or sticky positioning.

# User Goals
